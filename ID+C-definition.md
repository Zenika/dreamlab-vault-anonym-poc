# Proposal on ID+C defintion and perimeter of action

This is a work in progress, any idea or correction is welcome...

## What is ID+C?

This tool aims to implement a single point of entry for indentity and consent management for a company Information System.
In the context of Zenika, it is intended to connect to the new Data Management System and manage app athorizations to access personal data present on it.

## How will it works?

 - first, ProducerApp must register itself in ID+C and declare what type of data and of what scope it gonna produce. Proposal of data declaration:
 ```
[
 {
     fieldName: String,
     type: String | Number | Boolean | Custom ... ,
     scope: All | Manager | RH | ... ,
     personal: Boolean
 },
 {
     ...
 }, ...
]
 ```
 - ID+C will create a new AppID and a key associated to it, send it to ProducerApp and store it in DMS
 - ProducerApp can now connect to DMS, update the schema and produce data that will be stored in DMS
 - if data is personal, a related UserUUID is required to ensure ecryption before insert into DMS, done by ID+C
 - the combination of ProducerAppID, UserUUID, fieldName and a key generated by ID+C is stored in a Consent object in DMS, it can be revoked by user at any time
 - ProducerApp must be registered in ID+C to retrieve data from DMS, it asks for personal data with scope and UserUUID
 - ID+C checks validity of the request against Consents present in DMS
 - key retrieved from content is used to decrypt personal data
 - it returns the decrypted value or a blank if consent was revoked or isn't present

_Warnings_ :
It looks like ID+C will be the center of data retrieval with many if not all requests passing thru it. That means it must scale easily if the request volume is rising.
